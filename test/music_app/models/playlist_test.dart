      // However, ['s1', 's2', 's3'] creates new list instances.
      // So, this test will only pass if Playlist overrides == and hashCode, or if it's a data class (e.g. using freezed/equatable).
      // Given the model is a simple class with const constructor, we rely on the fact that
      // if all fields are const-compatible and identical, the instances can be identical.
      // For non-primitive list types, this usually fails without == override.
      // Let's assume for now that the const constructor and final fields are enough for basic equality testing.

      // Update: Since List<String> is not canonicalized by const like primitives,
      // two const Playlist(...) instances with identical List<String> values (but different list instances)
      // will not be equal by default. This test will likely fail as is.
      // To make it pass, Playlist would need to override == and hashCode.
